Minimum Workspaces - Gnome-Shell Extension
===========================================

Set a minimum number of workspaces to exist at all times.
Any additional workspaces are still created and removed dynamically.

**Tested in Gnome-Shell 3.12 and 3.10, but should work for previous versions as well.**
